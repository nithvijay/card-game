# Welcome to The Inspector Game

Thanks for checking out this game, I appreciate it. If you have any feedback, [here is a form](#feedback-form).

## How to Play
This game is for 3-6 players. There isn't a hard upper limit, but it may get crazy with more than 6.

Once everyone is in the same room, you have the choice of many game options. If it's your first time, I'd recommend the default settings!

When everyone is ready, the game begins.

The goal of the game is to get as many coins as possible. Each turn a new inspector is chosen amongst the players, and the rest of the players are classified as merchants. Merchants have items, which are classified as legal goods or contraband and have a coin value attached. Each turn, each merchant must select 1-5 cards to bring to the market in a "bag", which the inspector can choose to inspect. If the merchant was bringing all legal goods into the market, then the inspector has to pay the sum of what those cards were worth. If the merchant was bringing even one contraband into the market, then the merchant has to pay the sum of all the items in the bag. If the inspector decides not to inspect a merchant, then the merchant gets the sum of the values of everything they bring in (including contraband). Whoever reaches the target score first, wins!

The game is organized into 4 stages.

- Stage 1: Discard
  - Merchants can discard and redraw up to their entire hand
- Stage 2: Selection
  - Merchants select 1-5 cards to bring into the market
- Stage 3: Inspection
  - For each merchant, the inspector decides whether or not to inspect their bag
- Stage 4: Scores
  - The current coin tallies are shown, a new inspector is chosen, and the next turn begins at Stage 1.
